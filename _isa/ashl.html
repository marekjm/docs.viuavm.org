    <h2> Semantics </h2>

    <p>
        Bits in source value are shifted to the left by the number specifier by the
        integer from the offset operand.
        Zeroes are used to pad the bit string from the right.
        Value of the most significant bit is preserved.
        The source value is modified in-place.
        The bits that were shifted out are put in the "out" register, if it is not void.
