    <h2> Semantics </h2>

    <p>
        Bits in source value are shifted to the right by the number specifier by the
        integer from the offset operand, zeroes are used to pad the value from the left.
        The source value is modified in-place.
        The bits that were shifted out are put in the "out" register, if it is not void.
