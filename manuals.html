    <h1> Incomplete </h1>

    <p>
        This section is embarassingly incomplete.
        In the meantime, try looking at <a href="{{ site.repository_url }}/tree/devel/sample">samples</a> directory containing roughly 4KLOC of
        sample Viua VM code (with comments).

    <p class="abstract">
        Below you can find manuals needed when writing software for Viua VM written as articles of varying length, accompanied by code samples in Viua assembly and,
        occasionally, other languages.

        Manuals cover a wide range of subjects, from the very basics (e.g. syntax, how to write simple programs, etc.), to the more
        advanced topics (such as concurrency primitives, FFI, resource management, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a
        <a href="/manual.txt">plaintext</a> version readable in the terminal (e.g. in lynx(1), or less(1) and
        the like);
        and two HTML versions: <a href="/manual.html">colorised</a> and
        <a href="/manual.nocolor.html">browser-default</a> version.
        The table of contents in HTML versions contains anchors to different parts of the document
        for easier navigation.
        However, it is served as a one big file so you can use the search functionality of less(1) or your
        browser of choice instead of relying on the hyperlinks.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="/manual.txt">plaintext</a> version </li>
            <li> <a href="/manual.html">colorised HTML</a> version </li>
            <li> <a href="/manual.nocolor.html">browser-default HTML</a> version </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> Intended audience </h3>

    <p>
        Nearly all manuals assume prior programming experience.
        Reasonable proficiency in using a UNIX-like environment is also assumed where necessary.
