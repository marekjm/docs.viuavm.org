    <p> This section is embarassingly incomplete.
    In the meantime, try looking at <a href="{{ site.repository_url }}/tree/devel/sample">samples</a> directory containing roughly 4KLOC of
    sample Viua VM code (with comments).

    <p class="abstract">
        Below you can find manuals needed when writing software for Viua VM written as articles of varying length, accompanied by code samples in Viua assembly and,
        occasionally, other languages.

        Manuals cover a wide range of subjects, from the very basics (e.g. syntax, how to write simple programs, etc.), to the more
        advanced topics (such as concurrency primitives, FFI, resource management, etc.).
