            <h2> Setting up </h2>

            <p>
                Before you can write and run programs on Viua VM you have to compile it for your system.
                This <a href="{{ site.url }}/requirements-and-build-process.html">page</a> explains the requirements, and
                the build process of Viua VM.
            </p>

            <h2> Manuals </h2>

            <p>
                <a href="/manuals.html">Manuals</a> are articles of varying length, explaining how to use the VM.
                Manuals cover a wide range of subjects, from the very basics (e.g. syntax, how to write simple programs, etc.), to the more
                advanced topics (such as concurrency primitives, FFI, resource management, etc.).
            </p>
