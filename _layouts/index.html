            <p class="summary"> <a href="/manuals.html">Manuals</a> are <em>short articles explaining how to use
            specific features of the machine</em>, intended to be reminders (a bit like <code>man</code> pages
            on *nix-like system) for people who already know what they are looking for.
            The reader is assumed to have prior C++ and Viua VM programming experience.

            <h1> Tutorials </h1>

            <p class="summary"> <a href="/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> are <em>articles of varying length, explaining
            how to program Viua VM, and related projects</em> (e.g. how to write a C++ extension module).
            These articles are written as easy to follow <em>step-by-step guides</em>, explaining majority of the things as
            they are encountered in text.
            The reader is expected to have prior programming experience, and be reasonably proficient in the craft.

            <h1> References </h1>

            <p class="note for-summary">References also contain VM instruction set reference, and bytecode format
            description. </p>
            <p class="summary"> <a href="/references.html">References</a> are <em>lists of features, with short examples</em>
            of usage (in the spirit of <a href="http://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>).
            They are intended either for people who just need to refresh their memory (what arguments does a function
            take, in which module was a function implemented, etc.), or people who are interested in feature lists.
