            tests under Valgrind, but it will take several minutes instead of seconds.

            <p class="abstract"> Getting started with Viua VM is straightforward; it is the standard "clone-make-test" procedure.
            Executing the follwing commands should give you a fully functioning VM (remeber to use GCC 5, GCC 6 or recent version
            of Clang++; the compiler you use must support at least C++11):

            <h1> Manuals </h2>

            <p class="summary"> <a href="/manuals.html">Manuals</a> are <em>short articles explaining how to use
            specific features of the machine</em>, intended to be reminders (a bit like <code>man</code> pages
            on *nix-like system) for people who already know what they are looking for.
            The reader is assumed to have prior C++ and Viua VM programming experience.

            <h1> Tutorials </h1>

            <p class="summary"> <a href="/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> are <em>articles of varying length, explaining
            how to program Viua VM, and related projects</em> (e.g. how to write a C++ extension module).
            These articles are written as easy to follow <em>step-by-step guides</em>, explaining majority of the things as
            they are encountered in text.
            The reader is expected to have prior programming experience, and be reasonably proficient in the craft.

            <p class="summary"> <a href="/references.html">References</a> are <em>lists of features, with short examples</em>
            of usage (in the spirit of <a href="http://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>).
            They are intended either for people who just need to refresh their memory (what arguments does a function
            take, in which module was a function implemented, etc.), or people who are interested in feature lists.
