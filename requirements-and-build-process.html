            <h1> Requirements </h1>

            <p> Following requirements must be met in order to compile and run Viua VM. </p>

            <h3> CPU architecture </h3>

            <p> 64 bit x86 is supported. 64 bit ARM should also work. Compiling and running Viua VM on 32 bit hardware is not tested. </p>

            <h3> Operating system and environment </h3>

            <p>
                Development and testing is performed on Linux with GNU toolchain.
                Various *BSD flavours should also work.
                In general, Viua VM should be capable of running on any UNIX-like operating system.
            </p>

            <p> Microsoft Windows operating systems are <strong>not</strong> supported. </p>

            <h3> Tools </h3>

            <p> Following tools should be available on the system to support compilation and development of the VM. </p>

            <h4> GNU Make </h4>

            <p> Build scripts depend on GNU Make. </p>

            <h4> Valgrind </h4>

            <p> Valgrind is used to test memory usage and ensure that the machine does not leak. </p>

            <h4> Python 3 </h4>

            <p> VM's test suite depends on Python 3. </p>

            <h4> Git </h4>

            <p> Viua VM uses Git as the version control software. </p>

            <h3> C++ Compiler </h3>

            <p>
                Viua VM requires a reasonably up-to-date C++ compiler supporting C++17.
                Both GCC (version 7 and later, 6 may also suffice but is no longer tested) and Clang (5 and later) are supported.
            </p>

            <h1> Compilation </h1>

            <p> Assuming all requirements are met, below steps should give you a working Viua VM. </p>

            <h1> "Hello World!" </h1>

            <p>
                To honour the decades-old tradition, this is the first program one should write in a new language.
                Here is how to compile and run the "Hello World!" program on Viua VM.
            </p>

            <h3> Source code </h3>

            <p>
                Open an editor and copy the code presented below to a file.
                Lines beginning with <code>--</code> are comments and may be omitted.
                Everything else must be copied verbatim.
            </p>

            {% highlight lua %}
-- Functions begin with the '.begin:' directive followed by a function name.
-- Function names **must** include the arity.
-- Arity is checked at compile time at the call site.
.function: main/0
    -- Store string in first register of local register set.
    text %1 local "Hello World!"

    -- Print the contents of first register from local register set.
    print %1 local

    -- These two instruction **must** appear at the end of the main/0 function.
    -- This is enforced by the compiler.
    izero %0 local
    return
-- Function definitions are finished using the '.end' directive.
.end
            {% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                The source code has to be compiled into bytecode before the VM can run it.
                Assembler is located at <strong><em><code>./build/bin/vm/asm</code></em></strong>, relative to the main repository directory.
                VM kernel is located at <strong><em><code>./build/bin/vm/kernel</code></em></strong>, relative to the main repository directory.
            </p>

            {% highlight bash %}
]$ vi hello_world.asm
# ... paste the code copied from above and save the file ...
]$ ./build/bin/vm/asm hello_world.asm
]$ ./build/bin/vm/kernel a.out
Hello World!
]$ 
            {% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                You can run the compiled file through a disassembler.
                This is an optional step - disassembling is mentioned here for the curious individuals who may be interested in the fact that disassembly capabilities are provided out-of-the-box.
                In the example below the disassembler is run with some options that make it produce more verbose output.
            </p>

            {% highlight bash %}
]$ # The --info option prints additional information the VM can infer from the supplied binary.
]$ # The --with-entry option prints out the source of the special __entry function that is the entry point of Viua VM programs, and
]$ # is generated automatically by the assembler.
]$ ./build/bin/vm/dis --info --with-entry a.out
            {% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                The resulting output should be similar to the one presented below (assuming you did not modify the example code to print, for example, "Hello Joe!").
            </p>

            {% highlight lua %}
-- bytecode size: 78
--
-- functions:
--   main/0 -> 35 bytes at byte 0
--   __entry -> 43 bytes at byte 35


.function: main/0
    strstore %1 local "Hello World!"
    print %1 local
    izero %0 local
    return
.end

.function: __entry
    ress local
    frame %0 %16
    call %1 local main/0
    move %0 local %1 local
    halt
.end
            {% endhighlight %}
