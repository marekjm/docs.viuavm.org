    <p> This section is incomplete.
    In the meantime, try looking at <a href="{{ site.repository_url }}/tree/devel/sample">samples</a> directory containing roughly 4KLOC of
    sample Viua VM code (with comments).

    <h1>Canonical program: Hello World!</h1>

    <p> This is the simples program one can write in Viua VM, it just prints "Hello World!" to the standard output, and exits.

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
    -- functions begin with .function: <name>/<arity>
    .function: main/0

    -- this line is actually two instructions: 'echo' and 'strstore'
    -- "parenthesized" instructions are unwrapped-up, meaning that the instruction
    -- in the innermost parenthesis will be executed first
    --
    -- in this case, the 'strstore' will be executed first, and 'echo' second
    echo (strstore 1 "Hello ")

    -- this is equivalent to the previous line, only unwrapped (as seen by assembler)
    ststore 1 "World"
    echo 1

    -- the 'strstore' instruction creates a string object, and makes it available in a register
    -- both single quotes (') and double quotes (") can be used as string delimiters
    -- there is no character type, characters are just one-sized strings
    -- strings are plain ASCII (there is not Unicode support yet)
    --
    -- syntax of the 'strstore' instruction is as follows:
    --
    --  strstore <register-index> <quoted-string>
    --
    strstore 1 '!'

    -- the 'print' instruction prints stringified object and a newline to the
    -- standard output
    -- the 'echo' instruction prints stringified object to the standard output, but
    -- does not append the extra newline
    -- both instructions take register index as an argument
    print 1

    -- functions end with .end
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}
