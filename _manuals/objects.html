    <h1> Overview </h1>

    <p class="summary"> Objects in Viua VM are just a key-value stores, with type.
    Classes are descriptions that map method names to their implementing functions, and
    are used for dynamic dispatch.
    </p>

    <p> Viua is a virtual machine, not a programming langauge, so one can argue that it is wrong to put the notion of "objects" and "classes" inside it,
    that the VM should instead provide the primitives used to build objects inside the user code.
    However, Viua does ship with a language - a kind of high-level assembly, which is a compilation target for higher level languages, but can be used
    to program the VM directly.
    </p>

    <p> The assembly language provided by Viua is a very thin abstraction over VM's instruction set, that is, there is one-to-one mapping between the
    source code and what the machine executes.
    The instruction set provides simple primitives (and some more complex ones), which can be used to implement the behaviour required by user code.
    These primitives include operations to create objects (plain key-value stores), and classes (type descriptions).
    </p>

    <p> Users are not forced to use the high-level primitives provided by the VM, and can roll their own instead (using the machine-provided ones to
    implement them).
    This manual describes objects and classes as implemented in the VM; this information can be used to implement different models of object orientation,
    should such need arise.

    <h1> Classes and object </h1>

    <p class="summary"> Viua provides two basic compound data types: <code>Vector</code>, and <code>Object</code>.
    This manual discusses the <code>Object</code> type as it is the one used to build user-defined data types.
    </p>

    <h2> Classes </h2>

    <p> In Viua, classes are maps between method names, and names of functions that implement them.
    For example, a <code>Foo</code> class may provide a method <code>bar/2</code>, which is mapped to a function <code>baz/2</code>.
    When the method <code>bar/2</code> is called on an object of type <code>Foo</code> the VM will check type of the object, look up description of the type,
    see what function the dispatched method has been mapped to, and call this function.
    This is what classes in Viua are at the most basic level: maps.
    </p>

    <p> Classes can also build hierarchies, and Viua implements multiple inheritance so that hierarchies can become quite involved;
    the algorithm used for inheritance hierarchy linearisation is described later.
    Inheritance works as one would expect it - classes lower in hierarchy can override methods (i.e. map different function to the same method name), and
    when a method is not implemented in a derived class VM looks for it in base classes.
    </p>

    <p> Classes do not have to share a common root (a style some other VMs require), but this is also not prohibited.
    Even though type hierarchies may be completely disconnected, every object responds to a set of basic methods (e.g. can provide its own type, can be
    stringified, etc.).
    </p>

    <h2> Objects </h2>

    <p> In Viua, objects are key-value stores where keys are strings, and values can be anything: functions, integers, strings, or other objects.
    Objects also have associated class, used for dynamic dispatch.
