    <h1> These docs are a mess! What's that? </h1>
    <p> This documentation is inteneted to be accessible, and easy to follow.
    However, what is easy and straightforward for a core developer, may not be that clear to a person from outside the project.
    Please remember that this documentation is only a draft, and is in the process of being written.

    <p> Thank you for your cooperation. </p>

    <p class="summary"> {{ page.summary }} </p>

    <p> Viua VM does not implement shared-memory concurrency.
    Each virtual process inside Viua is contained in its own environment, and
    communicates with other processes using messages.
    There are no locks, mutexes, condition variables, etc. at the user visible level, but
    Viua uses such tools at the implementation level.
    </p>

    <p> This manual discusses both user-visible message passing tools provided as Viua opcodes and
    methods of standard objects, as well as the implementation details of mentioned user-level tools.
    </p>

    <p> In the first part, the user-level message passing is explained.
    The second part discusses implementation of provided user-level primitives.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="chapter">
    <h1> Part 1: user-level primitives </h1>

    <p class="summary"> Four primitives are provided to programmers to use: a means to <em>spawn a process</em>,
    to <em>join a process</em>, and to <em>send and receive messages</em>.
    Each primitive is discussed in relevant section below.
    </p>

    <h2> Spawning processes </h2>

    <p> Processes are spawned from functions.
    Whenever a new process is spawned it needs a main function, i.e. the function that is the top-most function on
    the call stack of the process.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
    .function: fn_to_run_in_a_process/0
        print (strstore 1 "Hello World!")
        return
    .end

    .function: main/0
        -- a frame is needed to spawn a process
        -- it is used as a top-most frame on the stack of the newly spawned process
        frame 0

        -- `process` instruction puts a process handle inside the target register
        process 1 fn_to_run_in_a_process/0
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> Viua VM implements SMP, so on a machine with sufficient hardware resources (and on a VM that is compiled with
    multiple VP schedulers) the two processes can run in parallel.
    </p>

    <h2> Joining processes </h2>

    <p> A process can be joined with another process.
    When process "A" joins process "B", process "A" is blocked until process "B" stops.
    Stopping may mean that the process finished running, or has been terminated by a runaway exception.
    If process "B" is terminated when process "A" joins it the exception is transferred to process "A", and
    process "A" becomes responsible for handling it.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
        -- `process` instruction puts a process handle inside the target register
        process 1 a_long_running_operation/2

        -- `join` puts return value of the main function of joined process in target register, or
        -- throws an exception if joined process has been terminated
        --
        -- syntax: join <target-register> <process-handle>
        -- target register 0 causes join instruction to drop return value and
        -- just block until joined process stops
        join 2 1
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h2> Sending messages </h2>

    <p> To send a message to another process, a process needs a handle for the recipient of the message.
    The handle may be passed as an argument to a function, or may arrive in a message.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
        .name: 1 process_handle
        .name: 2 message_to_send

        -- to send a message through a process handle, the pass/2 method is used
        frame ^[(param 0 process_handle) (param 1 message_to_send)]
        msg 0 pass/2
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h2> Receiving messages </h2>

    <p class="note important-note">As of version 0.8.3 there is no timeout mechanism to unblock a proces after a
    specified time if no message is available.
    </p>
    <p> To receive a message <code>receive</code> instruction is used.
    This operation may potentially block a process until a message arrives.
    </p>

    <div class="clear"></div>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
        .name: 1 process_handle
        .name: 2 received_message

        -- the `receive` instruction is used to fetch messages that
        -- were sent to the process
        --
        -- it is a potentially blocking operation
        receive received_message process_handle
    {% endhighlight %}

<section class="chapter">
    <h1> Part 2: implementation details </h1>

    <p class="summary"> Messages are sent by a process, passed around inside the VM, and
    then delievered and (usualy) fetched by their recipient process.
    This section discusses internal mechanisms employed by Viua VM to implement message passing primitives
    provided at the user-level.
    </p>

    <p> When a message is sent it is first delievered to the mailbox inside the CPU, assiciated with the recipient process.
    Mailboxes are located inside the CPU as it is the only constant element in a running Viua.
    There may be many VP and FFI schedulers executing in parallel, and
    to avoid deadlocking due to unexpected combination of message sends, process joins, foreign calls etc. a greater part of
    communication between virtual processes is synchronised by the CPU in message queues.
    </p>

    <p> When a process executes the <code>receive</code> instruction it receives first message available in its queue.
    The scheduler fetches new messages (if there are any) from the CPU every time a process executes the <code>receive</code> instruction
    to always present the process a complete queue with the most recent messages.
    It may seem as a sub-optimal solution (if you have buffered messages in local queue, why fetch more from a resource that requires
    locking?), but provides processes with the most accurate view of the incoming communications.
    From the proces point of view there would be no difference if the messages were always fetched, or only if the queue was empty, so
    this behaviour may change in the future.
    </p>

    <p> Sending messages works in a similar fashion to receiving.
    Every time a process sends a message it obtains a lock inside the CPU and
    delievers the message to an appropriate mailbox immediately.
    This is because receiving process <em>knows</em> when it wants to receive, but sending process does not, so the VM tries to get
    the message to the recipient as soon as possible after it is sent.
    </p>

    <h3> Message passing between processes on the same scheduler </h3>

    <p class="note important-note"> This is not implemented as of version 0.8.3 </p>
    <p> If a process sends a message to another process executing on the same scheduler the message is delievered immediately, without
    passing through mailbox inside the CPU to avoid needless locking.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <p> A special case of messaging inside a single scheduler are death messages.
    These are the messages sent to watchdog process when a process is terminated by a runaway exception, and
    no other process waits for its completion (i.e. no process executed <code>join</code> on it).
    Since watchdog processes are always spawned per scheduler and cannot migrate between schedulers, they do not even have mailboxes
    inside the CPU - all their messages are delievered directly.
    </p>

    <p> A good analogy is that cross-scheduler messages are like mail delivered by ordinary postal service, and
    scheduler-internal messages are like mail delivered by courier service.
    In the former case you have to go to the post office to fetch the mail (lock the mailbox inside the CPU, and
    check if there are any messages), while in the latter case the mail delivered to you directly (without any need for locking).
    </p>
