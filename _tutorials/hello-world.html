    <h3> Code organisation </h3>

    <p> It is recommended to create a special directory for Viua tutorials, e.g. <code>~/projects/tutorials/viuavm</code> and
    put tutorial code there.
    This way you will neither litter your system, nor lose your code (as it will be sitting in a designated directory).

    <h2> Creating a Viua VM program </h2>

    <p> First, open <code>main.asm</code> file your editor, and type the following code.
    Comments provide brief explanations so that you will know why you are typing each element
    of the program.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
    -- functions begin with .function: <name>/<arity>
    .function: main/0

    -- this line is actually two instructions: 'echo' and 'strstore'
    -- "parenthesized" instructions are unwrapped-up, meaning that the instruction
    -- in the innermost parenthesis will be executed first
    --
    -- in this case, the 'strstore' will be executed first, and 'echo' second
    echo (strstore 1 "Hello ")

    -- this is equivalent to the previous line, only unwrapped (as seen by assembler)
    ststore 1 "World"
    echo 1

    -- the 'strstore' instruction creates a string object, and makes it available in a register
    -- both single quotes (') and double quotes (") can be used as string delimiters
    -- there is no character type, characters are just one-sized strings
    -- strings are plain ASCII (there is not Unicode support yet)
    strstore 1 '!'

    -- the 'print' instruction prints stringified object and a newline to the
    -- standard output
    -- the 'echo' instruction prints stringified object to the standard output, but
    -- does not append the extra newline
    -- both instructions take register index as an argument
    print 1

    -- the 'izero' instruction creates an object representing integer 0 and
    -- makes it available in a register
    -- here, register 0 is used as it has special meaning to the VM - when a function
    -- returns its return value is taken form the zeroeth register
    izero 0

    -- the 'return' instruction returns from the function, and pops its frame from the stack
    -- all objects created inside the function are destroyed immediately
    return

    -- functions end with .end
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}

<section class="chapter">
    <h2> Program structure </h2>

    <p> There are some things you ought to observe when writing Viua VM programs.
    First, every program is built from functions and instructions.
    No instruction may appear outside of a function, so a function may be considered the smallest
    builing block of a Viua VM program.
    Functions are defined as follows:
    </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
    -- function definitions begin with the `.function:` token followed by function signature
    .function: foo/0

        --
        -- here is the function's body
        -- inside a function only instructions are valid
        -- functions cannot be nested
        --

        -- functions MUST end with the `return` instruction
        return

    -- function definitions end with the `.end` token
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> These two parts: <code>.function: foo/0</code> and <code>.end</code> (assembler directives) are
    removed when the source is transformed into the executable form, they are there only for
    the programer and the assembler.
    Now, lets analyse a full example.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
    .function: print_hello/0
        strstore 1 "Hello World!"
        print 1
        return
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h3> Function signature </h3>

    <p> The first line begins the definition.
    It's the <code>.function:</code> assembler directive beginning a function definition, followed
    by <code>print_hello/0</code>, which is the function's signature.
    </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
    .function: print_hello/0
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Function signatures are composed of two parts: the <em>name</em>, and the <em>arity</em>.
    The "name" part of the signature is an alphanumeric string, beginning with either a letter or
    an underscore, followed by zero or more letters, digits and underscores.
    Second part of the signature is the "arity" which encodes the number of arguments the function takes.
    It is a valuable information for programmer, and compiler.
    Arity is separated from the name part by a slash.
    </p>
    <p> Here are some examples of valid function signatures:
        <ul>
            <li> <code>foo/0</code> </li>
            <li> <code>bar/1</code> </li>
            <li> <code>baz_bay/3</code> </li>
            <li> <code>add2/1</code> </li>
            <li> <code>Sherlock_Holmes/0</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>

    <p> Second line is the <code>strstore</code> instruction. </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
        strstore 1 "Hello World!"
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> This instruction creates a string object with contents given between the quotes, and
    makes it available using the register index, in this case - <code>1</code>.
    The string object this instruction creates may be referenced by other instructions by giving
    them the register index assiciated with it as an operand.
    Let's consider a simple example:
    </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
    -- `istore` instruction creates an integer object and
    -- makes it available through a register index
    -- create 23 and "put it inside" register 1
    istore 1 23

    -- create 19 and put it inside register 2
    istore 2 19

    -- add contents of register 2 to contents of register 2, and
    -- make the result available through register 3
    iadd 3 1 2
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> In the last instruction the digits 1, 2 and 3 do not represent themselves; they represent register indexes.
    </p>

    <p> In instructions which may create new objects, the first operand is always the <em>target register</em>, i.e.
    it is index of the register in which the result of the instruction will be stored.
    This rule is introduced because it simplifies parsing, and makes it easier to remember which registers may be modified by
    an instruction.
    </p>
    <p> Some instructions "modify" more than one register, and some modify none.
    Not all instructions fall exactly into this scheme of target-first because sometimes it's not clear what is the
    target.
    Good rule of a thumb is: if an instruction writes, it always writes to the first operand.
    As an example of an instruction that breaks this rule, take the second instruction of the program being analysed:
    </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
        print 1
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p class="note"> One could argue that the print instruction technically performs a "write" - to the standard output. </p>
    <p> <code>print</code> instruction does not write to a register - it reads from one, even though the index is its first operand.
    Another such instruction is <code>echo</code> (present in the first program in this tutorial).
    There are also instructions that do not take any register indexes as operands, or any operands at all.
    First such instruction you encountered is:
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    {% highlight lua %}
        return
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> It returns from a function.
    It does not read any registers, it does not write to any registers, it does not do anything except signal that a function
    finished execution, its call frame may be removed from stack, and control may be returned to the caller.
    </p>

    <p> The last line in the analysed example... </p>

    {% highlight lua %}
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p> ...tells the assembler that the function's body has eneded.
    Function bodies always appear between <code>.function:</code> and <code>.end</code>.
    No instructions may also appear outside of these two directives.
    For example, below program is illegal:
    </p>

    {% highlight lua linenos %}
    -- instructions cannot appear outside of functions
    strstore 1 "Hello World!"

    .function: f/0
        print 1
        return
    .end
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h2> Main function in executables </h2>

    <p> Every program that will be directly executed by the VM <strong>MUST</strong> define a main
    function (libraries are exempt from this rule because they are linked into other programs, and
    thus executed "indirectly").
    </p>
</section>

<section class="chapter">
    <h2> Running a Viua VM program </h2>

    <p> The sample program must be compiled before VM can execute it.
    To compile and execute the program use the following commands:

    {% highlight bash %}
    $ vi hello.asm          # type the above code, save and exit
    $ viua-asm hello.asm    # you may give -o <output> option to the assembler, to specify the output file
    $                       # by default it is 'a.out'
    $ viua-vm a.out         # execute the program
    Hello World!
    {% endhighlight %}
