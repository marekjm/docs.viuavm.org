    <h1> Incomplete </h1>

    <p> This manual may be incomplete. Should anything be unclear, incomprehensible, or just plain wrong, please file a bug report. </p>

<section class="chapter">
    <h1> Prerequisites </h1>

    <p class="summary"> There are some minimal requirements that you must fulfill before you can begin the installaction process.
    They are listed and explained in this section.
    </p>

    <h2> C++ compiler </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that you compile Viua with GCC 6.1.1 or later.
    </p>
    <p> Viua VM must be compiled using a relatively recent C++ compiler; the compiler must support C++14, or at least C++11.
    If the compiler you have available supports only C++11 you have to set <code>CXX_STANDARD</code> variable inside the <code>Makefile</code>
    to <code>c++11</code> (by default it is set to <code>c++14</code>).
    It is recommended to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> compiler (version 5.3 or later).
    If you do not have GCC available, the VM can also be compiled with <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> (version 3.5 or later).
    </p>

    <h2> Operating system </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that you are on the Linux operating system, but any *nix-like operating system should be sufficient
    to run the VM.
    </p>
    <p> The development and testing of the VM is done on Linux.
    There are rumours that the VM is also able to run on FreeBSD, although there were some problems with the way symbols in shared libraries
    are resolved (which lead to crashes when using foreign modules), but this should no longer be a problem.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2> Hardware </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that your CPU has at least two cores available. </p>
    <p> The VM can run on x86_64 and ARMv8.
    The list of hardware the VM is regularly tested on is quite short at the moment:

        <ul>
            <li>Amlogic ARM® Cortex®-A53(ARMv8): 2.0Ghz, 4C</li>
            <li>AMD A10-7850K: 3.7Ghz, 4C</li>
            <li>Intel® Core(TM) i5-2400: 3.1GHz, 4C</li>
        </ul>

    The VM is not tested on any 32 bit system.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2> Internet connection </h2>

    <p> It is best that you would have a relatively stable Internet connection to fetch updates from the repository, and
    be able to access (however scarce) documentation.
    It is not neccessary, though and you can do without it, provided you can access Internet once in a while at your local
    library, University or similar organisation to download the code and docs in bigger chunks.
    If this is the case, I would advise you to clone not only the repository with code, but also the documentation website
    sources.
