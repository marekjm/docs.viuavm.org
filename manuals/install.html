    <p class="abstract"> This manual contains compilation and installation instructions; steps you have to take in order to get Viua VM running on your system.
    </p>

<section class="big-fat-warning big-yellow-warning">
    <h1> Incomplete </h1>

    <p> This manual may be incomplete. Should anything be unclear, incomprehensible, or just plain wrong, please file a bug report. </p>
</section>

<section class="chapter">
    <h1> Prerequisites </h1>

    <p class="summary"> There are some minimal requirements that you must fulfill before you can begin the installaction process.
    They are listed and explained in this section.
    </p>

    <h2> C++ compiler </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that you compile Viua with GCC 6.1.1 or later.
    </p>
    <p> Viua VM must be compiled using a relatively recent C++ compiler; the compiler must support C++14, or at least C++11.
    If the compiler you have available supports only C++11 you have to set <code>CXX_STANDARD</code> variable inside the <code>Makefile</code>
    to <code>c++11</code> (by default it is set to <code>c++14</code>).
    It is recommended to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> compiler (version 5.3 or later).
    If you do not have GCC available, the VM can also be compiled with <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> (version 3.5 or later).
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2> Operating system </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that you are on the Linux operating system, but any *nix-like operating system should be sufficient
    to run the VM.
    </p>
    <p> The development and testing of the VM is done on Linux.
    There are rumours that the VM is also able to run on FreeBSD, although there were some problems with the way symbols in shared libraries
    are resolved (which lead to crashes when using foreign modules), but this should no longer be a problem.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2> Hardware </h2>

    <p class="note"> This manual assumes that your CPU has at least two cores available. </p>
    <p> The VM can run on x86_64 and ARMv8.
    The list of hardware the VM is regularly tested on is quite short at the moment:

        <ul>
            <li>Amlogic ARM® Cortex®-A53(ARMv8): 2.0Ghz, 4C</li>
            <li>AMD A10-7850K: 3.7Ghz, 4C</li>
            <li>Intel® Core(TM) i5-2400: 3.1GHz, 4C</li>
        </ul>

    The VM is not tested on any 32 bit system.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2> Internet connection </h2>

    <p> It is best that you would have a relatively stable Internet connection to fetch updates from the repository, and
    be able to access (however scarce) documentation.
    It is not neccessary, though and you can do without it, provided you can access Internet once in a while at your local
    library, University or similar organisation to download the code and docs in bigger chunks.
    If this is the case, I would advise you to clone not only the repository with code, but also the documentation website
    sources.
    </p>

    <h2> Tools </h2>

    <p class="note important-note"> Python and Valgrind are required to run full test suite.
    </p>
    <p> Several additional tools are required for the development of the VM:

        <ul>
            <li> Valgrind 3.11 (or later): required to run memory tests </li>
            <li> Python 3.5 (or later): required to run test suite </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<section class="chapter">
    <h1> Obtaining and compiling code </h1>

    <p> This section describes how to obtain and compile Viua VM code. <p>

    <h2> Cloning the repository </h2>

    <p> You can fetch the code from Github.
    In order to do so, go to your projects directory, and clone the repository.
    Example:

    {% highlight bash %}
             ~ $ cd ~/projects
    ~/projects $ git clone --recursive --branch devel {{ site.repository_url }}
    ~/projects $ cd ./viuavm
    {% endhighlight %}

    This should give you the most recent version of the code in repository.
    </p>

    <h2> Compilation </h2>

    <p class="note important-note"> Remember to set the <code>CXX_STANDARD</code> variable in Makefile to <code>c++11</code>
    before compilation if your compiler does not support C++14.
    </p>
    <p> Compilation is performed using <code>make</code> tool.

    {% highlight bash %}
    # the `-j 4` tells make to execute 4 "jobs" at once, this may speed up the compilation
    # for best results (i.e. shortest compilation time) give `-j` the number of cores your machine
    # has available
    $ make -j 4
    {% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <p> If you are on Linux, you may also use developer scripts to compile the machine.
    They automate the process a bit more than just plain make, but are not guaranteed to work on every
    system; they require <code>dc</code> (desktop calculator), <code>xargs</code>, <code>sed</code> and
    a few other tools to be present.

    {% highlight bash %}
    # automatically detects if your compiler supports C++14, supports only GCC
    $ ./scripts/regenerate_cxxflags.sh
    {% endhighlight %}

    {% highlight bash %}
    # automatically detects how many cores your machine has and
    # executes make with appropriate -j argument
    $ ./scripts/compile
    {% endhighlight %}

    {% highlight bash %}
    # performs a "clean build"
    # removes all files compiled earlier, automatically detects
    # how many cores your machine has and executes make with
    # appropriate -j argument
    $ ./scripts/recompile
    {% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <h2> Testing compilation </h2>

    <p class="note"> Tests may take several minutes, you can make yourself a coffee or a cup of tea in the meantime,
    unless you have a fast CPU.
    </p>
    <p> After compilation you should verify if the VM is working correctly.
    This can be done by executing the test suite; it will check if all the features of the VM are in working
    order (compilation, disassembling, static and dynamic linking, linking and calling FFI modules and
    functions, etc.).

    {% highlight bash %}
    $ make test
    {% endhighlight %}

    If all tests finish successfully the VM should work on your system.
    </p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <p> Do not run the test suite manually; always use the <code>make test</code> or the <code>./scripts/test_quick</code> wrapper
    because they will setup required environment variables (e.g. <code>VIUAPATH</code>) for you.
    </p>

    <h1> Installing </h1>

    <p> Installation of Viua is simple: <code>make install</code> should do the trick.
    It will install Viua binaries to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, the standard library to
    <code>/usr/local/lib/viua/std</code>, and header files to <code>/usr/local/include/viua</code>.
    Alternatively, Viua can be installed locally:

    {% highlight bash %}
    $ make PREFIX=/home/joe/.local install
    $ viua-vm --version     # if this command works, Viua has been installed successfully
    {% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <p> If you choose to install in a non-standard location, you have to set the <code>VIUAPATH</code>
    environment variable in your shell's rc file to let Viua know where to look for libraries.
    The <code>VIUAPATH</code> is a typical PATH-type environment variable - a colon-separated list of
    directories the VM will check when it looks for a library.
    Example: <code>export VIUAPATH='/usr/local/software/viuavm:/home/joe/.local/viuavm/lib'</code>.
    </p>
